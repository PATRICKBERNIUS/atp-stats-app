This project scraped data from the ATP Stats website : https://www.atptour.com/en/stats/stats-home

Data was collected from the Individual Stats, Leaderboard, and Win Loss Index pages, from 1991-2025. I then used this data to create an interactive and filterable app that allows users to visualize player stats and performance over time, and compared to eachother.
